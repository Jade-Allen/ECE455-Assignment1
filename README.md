# ECE455-Assignment1

To compile and run code, use any Java IDE. We used Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

The program will create a file called "cachedsites.txt" which serves as the cache
for the proxy.

You can change the port in the main method found in "ProxyServer.java" to any port
you wish to use. 

Configuring firefox to use this proxy works best.
